    - Every grocery trip requires manually calculating all ingredients needed for your weekly meals
    - Time-consuming process of creating shopping lists from scratch
    - Easy to forget items or buy excess, leading to food waste

- **Poor Eating Habits**
    - It's too easy to fall into unhealthy patterns - choosing takeout over home-cooked meals

    - Lack of systematic approach to meal preparation and nutrition tracking
